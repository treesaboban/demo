        <b>Chicken Biriyani-kerala style</b><br><br>
        <p>
            Biryani is a classic Indian dish that is often served at weddings and celebrations.
            However, it is a common dish to occasionally be made at home for dinner as well.
            Making a chicken biryani is a lengthy process but once you taste the mixture of the chicken, spices, and rice, you will know that all your efforts were totally with it!

        <p>
            A hamburger, or simply burger, is a food consisting of fillings—usually a patty of ground meat, typically beef—placed inside a sliced bun or bread roll.

        <b>ChattiChoru</b><br><br>
        <p>
            More than a sumptuous meal that fills your tummy and heart, chattichoru is an emotion for many. 
            Two Keralite friends who are settled in Chennai, Tamil Nadu, decided to sell their favourite chattichoru as they wished to serve delicious food on an affordable rate.
            Delicious rice served with fourteen dishes in an earthen pot is the highlight of their ‘Chattichoru’.

        <b>Sushi</b><br><br>
        <p>
            Sushi is traditionally made with medium-grain white rice, though it can be prepared with brown rice or short-grain rice. It is very often prepared with seafood, such as squid, eel, yellowtail, salmon, tuna or imitation crab meat. Many types of sushi are vegetarian.
            It is often served with pickled ginger (gari), wasabi, and soy sauce. Daikon radish or pickled daikon (takuan) are popular garnishes for the dish.
