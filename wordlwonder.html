        <h2>Chichen Itza - Mexico</h2>
        <p>
            Chichen Itza is located in Mexico and was built by the Mayan people.
             The Mayan people were a very advanced civilization, and their architecture is unbelievable. The Chichen Itza temple stands 79 feet above the main plaza and was built in such a way that it aligns with the sun during the spring and autumn equinoxes. During these equinoxes, the sun shines directly on the pyramid and casts a shadow in the shape of a snake. 
            It is truly an amazing sight to see.
